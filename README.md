# Lab-5
In this lab we tested the TIMER and PWM on our microcontroller.
In the first code for Q1 we used the WDT timer interrupt.
We toggled the red and green LED with a 256 msec interval.

In the second code for Q2 we generated a software PWM.
We used this to controll the LED brightness.
It had a 10% duty cycle and a 500 ms period.

In the third code for Q3 we generated a hardware PWM.
We used this to controll the LED brightness.
It had a 20% duty cycle and a 250 ms period.
